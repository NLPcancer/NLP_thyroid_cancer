Final Report

CLINICAL HISTORY
CA thyroid

SPECIMEN(S):
(A) Right thyroid, excision and (B) Left thyroid, excision

GROSS EXAMINATION:
(Specimen received in formalin)

(A) Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 25 g. It is labelled 'Right thyroid'. It measures 35 mm medial to lateral, 25 mm anterior to posterior, and 50 mm superior to inferior. The deep surface is inked with black dye. The anterior surface is inked with green dye. Serial sectioning does not shows any tumour.

(A1) Isthmic margin.
(A2)-(A14) Thyroid gland embedded from superior to inferior (specimen is all embedded).

(B)Received are two pieces of tissue weighing 8 g. The smaller piece measures 5 mm in greatest dimension. The larger piece measures 20 x 15 x 5 mm.

(B1) Smaller piece.
(B2) Larger piece (bisected), specimen all embedded.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
(A) Sections show a 0.6 mm papillary microcarcinoma in the thyroid parenchyma. It is non-encapsulated. The tumour cells are arranged in microfollicles and show enlarged, irregular pale nuclei with nuclear grooves. No lymphovascular permeation or perineural invasion is seen. This focus disappears in the deeper levels. The thyroid capsule and isthmic margin are free of involvement.

- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition):
- Primary tumor (pT):
- pT1a: Tumor < or = 1 cm, limited to the thyroid

The background thyroid shows small hyperplastic nodules and colloid cyst. A parathyroid gland is also included.

(B) Sections show a piece of thyroid tissue with small hyperplastic follicles. There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
(A) THYROID, right lobe, excision - PAPILLARY MICROCARCINOMA, pT1a.
(B) Thyroid, left, excision - No malignancy.
