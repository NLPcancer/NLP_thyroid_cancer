SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Right thyroid, resection, (B) Left thyroid, resection and (C) Right central compartment lymph node, resection 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (Specimen received in formalin) 
 (A) 'Right thyroid'. The weight of the specimen is 18.8 g. It is a cut open thyroid lobe measuring 4 x 2.8 x 2 cm. The cut open anterior surface showing fibrotic firm whitish tumour in the lower pole close to the posterior resection margin. The tumour measures 1.5 cm in maximum diameter. A strip of isthmic tissue is included. The anterior surface is inked green, posterior surface black, isthmic margin blue. Cut section of the thyroid shows firm calcified whitish tumour in the lower pole close to the posterior resection margin. The upper pole of the thyroid looks unremarkable. 
 
 All embedded in 8 blocks. 
 (A1)&(A2) One whole longitudinal slab with tumour including posterior resection margin. 
 (A3)&(A4) Tumour and the lateral resection margin. 
 (A5)-(A6) Tumour and the isthmic margin. 
 (A7)&(A8) Remaining tissue with upper pole. 
 (B) 'Left thyroid'. The weight of the specimen is 10.7 g. It is a left lobe with isthmus. The whole piece of tissue measures 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The isthmus measures 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The anterior margin is inked green, posterior margin black and the isthmic margin blue. Tissue is cutting and all embedded from upper pole to lower pole in 6 blocks. 
 
 (C) 'Right central compartment lymph node'. It contains two pieces of brownish nodular tissue measure 0.8 cm to 2 cm. Both pieces of tissue are bisected and embedded in 2 blocks. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 (A) Right thyroid, resection, 
 - Tumor histology : 
  - The thyroid nodule show features of papillary carcinoma with extensive calcification and infiltrative border. It extends to resection margin and invasion of extrathyroid fatty tissue is noted. One small lymph node with metastasis is included near the isthmus. 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2 
- Tumor focality: Unifocal 
- Tumor size: Greatest dimension : 15 mm 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angionvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Present 
- Perineural invasion: Present 
- Extrathyroidal extension: fatty soft tissue at isthmus 
- Surgical margins: Touched posterior and lateral margins and involvement of extrathyroid soft tissue(A2, A3, A6). 
- Lymph nodes examination: 
  - Number of regional lymph nodes : 4 out of total of 6 (including specimen C) 
  - Extranodal extension (ENE) : Not identified 
  - Size of largest metastatic deposit (mm), specify site: 9 mm 
  - Size of largest lymph node involved (mm), specify site: 9.5 mm 
- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
  - Primary tumor (pT): 
    - pT1 (subcategory cannot be determined) 
  - Regional lymph nodes (pN): 
    - pN1a: Metastasis to regional nodes 
- Additional pathologic findings: 
  - Patchy lymphocytic infiltrate present. 
(B) Left thyroid, resection : 
The tissue is all embedded and shows no tumour in the thyroid parenchymal tissue. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia is noted. Lymphocytic infiltrate is mild and patchy. 
A tiny focus of crushed papillary carcinoma up to 0.5 mm is seen outside of thyroid capsule(B5), near isthmus, in keeping with extrathyroid extension from right thyroid tumour. 
(C) Right central compartment lymph node, resection 
There are five lymph nodes, three of them contains metastasis. 
 
Final Report 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
(A) Right THYROID, resection, 
- PAPILLARY CARCINOMA, classic subtype 
- Touched posterior and lateral margins with involvement of extrathyroid soft tissue 
- One lymph node with metastasis. 
(B) Left THYROID, resection : 
- A tiny focus of PAPILLARY CARCINOMA outside of thyroid capsule, in keeping with extrathyroid extension from right thyroid tumour. 
(C) Right central compartment LYMPH NODES, resection 
- METASTATIC PAPILLARY CARCINOMA(3/5).
