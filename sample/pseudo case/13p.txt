CLINICAL HISTORY: 
CA thyroid 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Right thyroid, resection, (B) Left thyroid, resection, (C) Tracheal margin, excision and (D) Left lateral neck dissection specimen, resection 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (Specimen received in formalin) 
 (A) Designated 'right thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 8.2 g. The specimen measures 5.1 cm from superior to inferior, 2.5 cm from medial to lateral and 0.9 cm from anterior to posterior. The anterior surface is inked with green dye, the posterior surface is inked with orange dye and the lateral surface is inked with blue dye. Serial sectioning shows a homogenous beefy red cut surface. No tumour is identified. Partially embedded in 4 blocks. 
 (A1) Isthmic margin, shaved. 
 (A2) Upper pole. 
 (A3) Middle pole. 
 (A4) Lower pole. 
 (B) Designated 'left thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 50.8 g. It measures 7 cm from superior to inferior, 5.1 cm from medial to lateral and 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The anterior surface is inked with green dye, the posterior surface is inked with orange dye and the lateral surface is inked with blue dye. Serial sectioning shows the lobe is mostly replaced by a firm tan-coloured tumour. It measures 6.3 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. The tumour encroaches on the anterior, posterior and lateral surfaces. 9 representative blocks. 
 (B1) Soft tissue, shaved. 
 (B2)-(B8) Thyroid tumour. 
 (B9) Perithyroidal soft tissue. 
 (C) Designated 'tracheal margin'. Received is a piece of tan-coloured soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm. All embedded in 1 block. 
 (D) Designated 'left lateral neck dissection specimen'. Received is a piece of fatty tissue with a tubular structure protruding from the surface. The whole specimen measures 7 x 5 x 1.9 cm. The tubular structure measures 4 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. There is a firm nodule within the fatty tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 2.1 cm. 
 Sectioning shows a tan-coloured, necrotic surface. Multiple smaller lymph nodes are palpable in the remaining adipose tissue. They measure up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Partially embedded in 10 blocks. 
 (D1) Tubular structure, serially sectioned and all embedded. 
 (D2)-(D5) Firm nodule, representative blocks. 
 (D6)-(D10) Smaller lymph nodes and adipose tissue, all embedded. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
(A) Sections of the thyroid gland show patchy stromal lymphocytic infiltrates, some with hyperplastic secondary follicle formation. A hyperplastic nodule, composed of microfollicles and normofollicles lined by uniform follicular cells, is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
(B) 
- Tumor histology and immunohistochemical studies: 
  - Sections show a papillary carcinoma of which the tumour cells are arranged in mixed papillary and follicular pattern. The tumour cells show crowded pale nuclei, some with nuclear grooving and occasional pseudonuclear inclusions. Psammoma bodies are identified in areas. Extrathyroidal tumour invasion into the surrounding skeletal muscle is identified (block B3). 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): 
  - Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2, specify: 1 mitosis per 2mm2 
- Tumor focality: Unifocal 
- Tumor size: Greatest dimension (mm): 63 mm (macroscopic) 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angionvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Present 
- Perineural invasion: Not identified 
- Surgical margins: 
  - The tumour measures less than 0.1 mm from the anterior, posterior and lateral margins (blocks B3 and B7). 
The intraoperative findings of 'gross ETE to surrounding muscles, posteriorly adherent to trachea and esophagus at cricoid level' is noted. Please correlate with imaging and intraoperative findings for pathologic tumor staging. 
- Additional findings: 
  - Two lymph nodes are sampled adjacent to the tumour. One of them is extensively replaced by sheets of carcinoma cells without extranodal spread. 
  - A benign parathyroid gland is present, which measures within 0.5 mm from the tumour (block B3). 
  - Some involuted thymic tissue is sampled (block B9). 
(C) Sections show a piece of fibroadipose tissue extensively infiltrated by a papillary carcinoma with mixed papillary and follicular pattern, similar to that seen in specimen (B). The tumour reaches the cauterized margin. 
(D) Sections show a total of 19 lymph nodes, one of them is extensively infiltrated by metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with extensive extranodal extension and marked stromal desmoplasia. Psammoma bodies are identified focally. One small lymph node shows small clusters of metastatic carcinoma. Lymphovascular permeation and perineural invasion are noted. Tumour coagulative necrosis is observed. A nerve is included in the specimen, of which the adjacent fibrous tissue is also extensively infiltrated by papillary thyroid carcinoma. 
 
- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
   - Regional lymph nodes (pN): 
     - pN1b: Metastasis to unilateral, bilateral, or contralateral lateral neck lymph nodes (levels I, II, III, IV, or V) or retropharyngeal lymph nodes 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right THYROID, resection 
 - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY 
 (B) Left THYROID, resection 
 - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA with invasion into skeletal muscle bundles; metastatic papillary carcinoma in one lymph node. (please see description) 
 (C) TRACHEAL margin, excision 
 - Involved by PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA 
 (D) LYMPH NODES, left lateral neck dissection specimen, resection 
 - METASTATIC PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA (2/19); pN1b
