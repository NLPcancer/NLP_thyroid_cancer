CLINICAL HISTORY: 
L PTC 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Left thyroid, resection, (B) Right thyroid, resection and (C) Left central compartment lymph node, resection 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 'Left thyroid'. The specimen consists of the left thyroid, isthmus and pyramidal lobe. It weighs 14.5 g. The left lobe measures 4.5 cm superoinferiorly, 2.5 cm anteroposteriorly and 1.8 cm transversely. The unremarkable isthmus and pyramidal lobe together measures 3.5 cm superoinferiorly, 2 cm transversely and 1 cm anteroposteriorly. The surface has a lobulated appearance with rupture at the anterior upper lobe, measures 2 cm in length. Serial transverse sectioning shows a well-circumscribed, tan-coloured lesion occupying almost the entire left lobe. It measures 3.9 cm superoinferiorly, 2.5 cm anteroposteriorly and 1.7 cm transversely. It is clear from the upper pole margin by 0.1 cm, the lower pole margin by 0.5 cm, and the isthmic margin by 1.7 cm. It abuts the anterior surface and posterior margin. 
 Partially embedded in 8 blocks. 
 Colour codes: anterior surface - blue; posterior margin - green; isthmus - black. 
 (A1) Pyramidal lobe. 
 (A2) Lesion and upper pole margin. 
 (A3) Lesion and lower pole margin. 
 (A4)&(A5), (A6)&(A7) Two complete lesional slabs. 
 (A8) Further sampling of lesion. 
 (B) 'Right thyroid'. A thyroid right lobe measures 4 cm superoinferiorly, 3.5 cm transversely, 2.5 cm anteroposteriorly and weighs 12.5 g. There is an incision at the anterior mid lobe measures 2.3 cm horizontally. Serial transverse sectioning shows an unremarkable cut surface. Partially embedded in 3 blocks. 
 Colour codes: anterior surface - blue; posterior margin - green; isthmus - black. 
 (B1) Upper pole. 
 (B2) Mid pole near the incision. 
 (B3) Lower pole. 
 (C) 'Left central compartment lymph node'. A piece of fibrofatty tissue measures 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. All embedded in 1 block. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
(A) 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, encapsulated classic subtype 
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2 mm2 
- Ki67 labeling index: 3% 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angioinvasion: Focal (< 4 vessels) (as confirmed by CD31 immunohistochemistry on block A5) 
- Extrathyroidal extension: Invading only strap muscles (block A7) 
- Tumor histology: 
  - The tumor is encapsulated and consists of carcinoma cells arranged as follicles or papillae with fibrovascular cores. Carcinoma cells are seen invading through the capsule in areas. The carcinoma cells display nuclear crowding, bearing enlarged, pale nuclei. Chromatin margination, nuclear grooves and occasional nuclear pseudoinclusions are seen. 
  - There is scant skeletal muscle adhered to the anterior aspect of the thyroid (blocks A5 and A7). Microscopic extrathyroid extension by carcinoma cells is observed, which is compatible with the operation findings of gross extrathyroidal extension. Near the upper pole (block A2) and posterior (block A7) margins, the carcinoma cells are seen amongst adipose tissue containing thick-walled vessels. 
- Surgical margins: Uninvolved by carcinoma, closest distance: 
  - Upper pole margin =   0.5 mm (block A2) 
  - Lower pole margin =     5 mm (block A3) 
  - Anterior surface  = < 0.1 mm (block A7) 
  - Posterior margin  =   0.4 mm (block A5) 
- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
  - Primary tumor (pT): pT3b, gross extrathyroidal extension invading only strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid, or omohyoid muscles) from a tumor of any size 
(B) Sections shows a couple of small hyperplastic thyroid nodules composed of variably sized colloid-filled follicles. No nuclear characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinoma are seen in the follicular cells. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
(C) The section shows a piece of adipose tissue containing one normal-looking parathyroid gland and a small amount of thyroid tissue. No nuclear characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinoma are seen in the follicular cells. No lymph nodal tissue is present. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
(A) Left THYROID, resection 
- Papillary thyroid carcinoma, pT3b (AJCC 8th edition) 
  - Encapsulated classic subtype with focal angioinvasion, 3.9 cm 
  - margins clear 
(B) Right THYROID, resection 
- NO MALIGNANCY. 
(C) Clinically left central compartment "LYMPH NODE", resection 
- Parathyroid gland and thyroid tissue present, no lymph node seen, NO MALIGNANCY.
