F/39Y  

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
CA thyroid 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  Right thyroid, resection 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
Designated 'Right thyroid'. Received is a lobe of the thyroid weighing 23 g. It measures 5.6 cm superoinferiorly, 3.5 cm mediolaterally and up to 2.5 cm anteroposteriorly.  It has been incised from the medial aspect upon receipt. 
Serially sectioning along the coronal plane shows a cystic tumour in the middle to lower pole. It measures 3.1 cm superoinferiorly, 2 cm transversely and 1.8 cm anteroposteriorly.  This cystic tumour is associated with some calcification and whitish ill-defined area. Superior and anterior to this tumour is another whitish fibrotic area, measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm. 
The surfaces are inked as follows: 
Anterior - blue 
Posterior - black 
Isthmic margin - green 
Representative sections are embedded in 9 blocks. 
(1)-(3) A complete slab of the cystic tumour along its greatest dimension (embedded from superior to inferior). 
(4)-(6) Another slab of tumour (embedded from superior to inferior). 
(7) Whitish fibrotic area anterior to the tumour. 
(8) Further sampling of cystic part of tumour. 
(9) Isthmic margin, perpendicularly sectioned. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
- Tumor histology: 
  - Sections of the thyroid shows a tumor measuring 30 mm in greatest dimension (Blocks 1 to 3), with areas of cystic change. The tumor is partly surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule, and shows a focally infiltrative border. The tumor consists of papillae and follicles lined by cuboidal cells with nuclear crowding and overlapping, pale chromatin, nuclear grooves and intranuclear pseudoinclusions. 
Occasional psammoma bodies are noted. 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2, specify: 1 
- Tumor focality: Unifocal 
- Tumor size: Greatest dimension: 30 mm (Blocks 1 to 3) 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angionvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
- Extrathyroidal extension : Not identified 
Final Report 
- Surgical margins: 
   - Anterior surface : Focally involved by carcinoma (Block 1) 
   - Posterior surface: Clear by more than 5 mm 
   - Isthmic margin   : Clear by 15.5 mm (Block 9) 
 - Pathologic stage classification (AJCC 8th edition): 
   - Primary tumor (pT): pT2: Tumor > 2 cm, but < or = 4 cm, limited to thyroid 
 - Additional notes: 
   - Posterior to the tumour, another hemorrhagic cyst is present. The lining is extensively denuded. It contains hemosiderin-laden and foamy macrophages, walled off by dense fibrosis. 
   - The background thyroid shows diffuse hyperplasia, comprising follicles of variable size, shape and colloid content. Some follicles are colloid depleted, whilst some show peripheral scalloping of colloid. Mild patchy lymphocytic infiltrates are seen. Coupled with the clinical and serological findings, features are compatible with Graves disease with treatment effect. 
   - An intra-thyroid parathyroid gland is present. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right THYROID, resection: 
 - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA 
   - Pathologic stage: pT2 (AJCC 8th edition) 
   - See microscopic description for margin status 
 - Compatible with GRAVES DISEASE with treatment effect
