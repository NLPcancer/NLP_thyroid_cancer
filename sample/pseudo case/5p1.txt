CLINICAL HISTORY: 
PTC 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Right thyroid, resection and (B) Left thyroid, resection 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 'Right thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 5.4 g. It measures 3.5 cm superoinferiorly, 2.2 cm mediolaterally and up to 1.5 cm anteroposteriorly. The anterior, posterior and lateral margins are inked green, black and blue respectively. Serial sectioning shows no grossly identifiable lesions. 4 representative blocks. 
 (A1) Shaved isthmic border. 
 (A2) Upper pole. 
 (A3) Middle pole. 
 (A4) Lower pole. 
 (B) 'Left thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 11 g. It measures 4.5 cm superoinferiorly, 3.8 cm mediolaterally and 2 cm anteroposteriorly. It has been incised open over the lower pole, revealing a whitish firm tumour measuring 2 cm superoinferiorly, 2 cm mediolaterally and 1.5 cm anteroposteriorly. Some adhesive peri-thyroidal muscle is found at lower pole nodule measuring 1.5 cm x 1 cm.  
Extension to perithyroidal muscle, anterior, lateral and posterior margins is noted. 
The isthmus is occupied by a circumscribed firm tumour, measuring 1.6 cm superoinferiorly, 1.5 cm mediolaterally and 1.3 cm anteroposteriorly. It extends to anterior margin and 0.1 cm away from posterior margin. The two tumours are 1.5 cm apart. The anterior, posterior and lateral margins are inked green, black and blue respectively. 9 representative blocks. 
 (B1)-(B3) Isthmus and all embedded isthmic tumour, sectioned in bread-loaf manner. 
 (B4)-(B7) Lower pole tumour, all embedded. 
 (B8) Upper pole. 
 (B9) Middle pole. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
(A) Sections of the thyroid show benign thyroid tissue with patchy lymphoid aggregates and focal nodular hyperplasia.  Some arterial vessels are calcified. There is no evidence of malignancy. A parathyroid gland is included. 
(B) 
- Tumor histology and immunohistochemical studies: 
  - Sections of both lower pole and isthmic tumours show features in keeping with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The tumour cells are arranged in microfollicles or papillary fronds. They display enlarged nuclei, distinct nucleoli and oncocytic cytoplasm. Nuclear grooves and occasional pseudonuclear inclusions are seen.  
Immunostaining shows the tumour cells are positive for TTF1 and thyroglobulin whilst negative for PTH, Calcitonin, S100, Chromogranin and GATA3. The non-tumor thyroid shows patchy lymphocytic infiltrate. 2 parathyroid glands are sampled, with involvement by papillary thyroid carcinoma in one. 3 lymph nodes are sampled with no malignancy. 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, oncocytic classic subtype 
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): 
  - Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2, specify: 2 per 2mm2 
- Tumor focality: 
  - Multifocal (2 foci) 
- Tumor size: 
  Lower pole tumour: 20 mm in greatest dimension 
  Isthmus tumour: 16 mm in greatest dimension 
- Tumor necrosis: 
  - Not identified 
- Angionvasion: Focally noted(B1) 
- Lymphatic invasion: Present (Block B3) 
- Extrathyroidal extension: Invading soft tissue and strap muscles (Please refer to operation record for gross extrathyroidal extension). Microscopic extrathyroidal extension is present (e.g. Block B4) 
- Surgical margins: Involved by carcinoma, specify: 
  - Anterior margin: Involved by tumour (Block B4) 
  - Posterior margin: Involved by tumour (Block B6) 
  - Lateral margin: Less than 0.1 mm (Block B4) 
- Lymph nodes examination: 
  - Number of regional lymph nodes: 1 out of total of 5 
  - Extranodal extension (ENE) : Not identified 
  - Size of largest metastatic deposit (mm), specify site: 0.6 mm  
- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
  - TNM Descriptors: 
     m (multiple primary tumors) 
  - Primary tumor (pT): 
- pT3b: Gross extrathyroidal extension invading only strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid, or omohyoid muscles) from a tumor of any size 
   - Regional lymph nodes (pN): 
     - pN1a: Metastasis to regional nodes 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right THYROID, resection: 
 - Lymphocytic thyroiditis with NO MALIGNANCY 
 (B) Left THYROID, resection: 
 - Multi-focal PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA with involved margins 
 - TNM staging mpT3bpN1a (AJCC 8th edition)
