M/66Y  
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 Left CA thyroid 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  Left thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 'Left thyroid'. A left thyroid weighs 8 g. It measures 4 cm vertically, 2 cm to 5 cm transversely and 2 cm anteroposteriorly. The posterior surface is inked blue, and  anterior inked green. A brown-coloured nodule with circumscribed borders is found near the lower region. It measures 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. No haemorrhage is found. The adjacent thyroid is unremarkable. 5 blocks. 
 (1) isthmic margin, trimmed. 
 (2)-(5) The nodule, all embedded [(2) also including a slab of adjacent thyroid]. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 Sections of the thyroid show an encapsulated follicular neoplasm. The capsule is of irregular thickness. The lesion is composed of follicles of variable size, many of them being small devoid of colloid content though normal-sized ones with colloid materials are found. Hurthle cell changes are conspicuous. No necrosis is seen. Mitosis is <1/10 HPF. Tongues of mushroom-type complete capsular invasion to adjacent thyroid parenchyma are found. No vascular permeation is identified. 
 Cytological atypia with nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia and irregular outline is seen, which may give rise to a suspicion of papillary thyroid carcinoma in cytological preparation. Features are consistent with minimally invasive follicular carcinoma with capsular invasion only. The adjacent thyroid displays mild nodular hyperplasia. The tumour focally involves the anterior margins (block 4). 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left THYROID, resection - MINIMALLY INVASIVE FOLLICULAR CARCINOMA with capsular invasion only (please see microscopic description)
