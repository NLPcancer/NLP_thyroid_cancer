CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 Left thyroid nodule 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 Left thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
Labelled 'Left thyroid'. Received is left lobe weighing 9.9 g and measuring 3 cm transversely, 4 cm superoinferiorly and 2 cm anteroposteriorly. The isthmus and pyramidal lobe together measures 2.5 cm superoinferiorly, 1 cm transversely and 0.5 cm anteroposteriorly. The isthmic margin is inked blue, posterior surface is inked green and anterior surface inked yellow. 
Serial sectioning in the axial plane shows a calcified nodule in the inferior pole, measuring 1.1 cm transversely, 0.9 cm anteroposteriorly and 1.4 cm superoinferiorly. 
A colloid nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter is seen adjacent to it. 6 representative blocks are taken. 
 (1) Isthmus and pyramidal lobe, perpendicularly taken. 
 (2) Superior pole. 
 (3)-(6) Calcified nodule, all embedded. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
- Tumor histology: Sections of the thyroid show a tumor surrounded by a fibrotic pseudocapsule with calcifications. The tumor consists of neoplastic follicular cells arranged in follicles and papillae. They display crowded enlarged nuclei, chromatin clearing, irregular nuclear outline, small nucleoli and occasional nuclear grooves and intranuclear pseudoinclusions. 
 - Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
 - Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2, specify: < 1 
 - Tumor focality: Unifocal 
 - Tumor size: 11.5 mm in greatest dimension microscopically (block 4) 
 - Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
 - Angionvasion: Not identified 
 - Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
 - Perineural invasion: Not identified 
 - Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
 - Surgical margins: 
   - Isthmic margin: Not involved by carcinoma 
   - Anterior surface: < 0.1 mm from carcinoma (block 3) 
   - Posterior surface: Not involved by carcinoma 
 - Pathologic stage classification (AJCC 8th edition): 
   - Primary tumor (pT): pT1b: Tumor > 1 cm but < or = 2 cm, limited to the thyroid 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left THYROID, resection: 
 - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA 
- Pathologic stage: pT1b (AJCC 8th edition) 
- See microscopic description for margin status
