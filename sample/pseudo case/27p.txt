Date Arrived: 11/07/2024 
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 Thyroid nodule 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Right thyroid, resection and (B) Right neck lipoma, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 'Right thyroid'. Received is a right thyroid measuring 4 cm superoinferiorly, 2 cm mediolaterally and 1.8 cm anteroposteriorly. The isthmus and pyramidal lobe measure 2.5 cm superoinferiorly, 1.7 cm mediolaterally and 0.8 cm anteroposteriorly. 
 The right thyroid is previously incised before receipt, revealing a well-circumscribed tan-yellowish nodule. Serial sectioning shows the nodule measures 2.2 cm superoinferiorly, 1.8 cm anteroposteriorly and 1.7 cm mediolaterally. It closely abuts the anterior, posterior and inferior margins. It is situated 2 cm from the superior margin. Adjacent to this nodule is a small whitish lesion with irregular borders measuring up to 0.5 cm in size. The anterior surface is inked yellow, posterior margin is inked green and isthmic margin is inked black. All 
 embedded in 11 blocks. 
(A1) Isthmus and pyramidal lobe, bisected. 
(A2)&(A7) Inferior margin, perpendicularly sectioned. 
(A3)-(A4) Tumour. 
(A5) Whitish lesion. 
(A6) Background thyroid. 
(A8) Further sampling of tumour and whitish lesion. 
(A9)-(A11) Remaining thyroid tissue. 
 
 (B) 'Right neck lipoma'. Received is a piece of yellowish fatty tissue measuring 3.6 x 2 x 1.5 cm. Serial sectioning shows no hemorrhage or necrosis. 4 representative blocks are taken. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 - Histologic type: 
 - Oncocytic adenoma (1 focus; blocks A2-A4 and A7-A8) 
 - Papillary carcinoma (2 foci; A4, A5 & A8 represent the larger focus, and A9 represents the smaller focus) 
 - Tumor focality: Multifocal 
 - Tumor size (Greatest dimension): 
 - Oncocytic adenoma: 22 mm (macroscopic) 
 - Papillary carcinoma: 5 mm (block A5) and 1.5 mm (block A9) 
 - Tumor histology: 
 - Sections show a well-circumscribed encapsulated tumour composed predominantly of oncocytic cells (> 75%). They are arranged in microfollicles and occasionally large-sized colloid-filled follicles. The tumour bulges onto the fibrous capsule with an isolated tiny island of tumour cells situated within the tumour capsule (block A3). No definite capsular invasion is seen despite serial deeper levels. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is found. There are foci of haemorrhage, cholesterol clefts and foamy macrophages, in keeping with previous FNA manipulation. 
 The tumour cells possess abundant eosinophils cytoplasm, enlarged vesicular nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli. Features are consistent with oncocytic adenoma. 
 - Two foci of papillary thyroid carcinoma are also incidentally found, which feature carcinoma cells arranged in follicles and occasionally papillary structures. 
 The stroma is fibrotic with psammoma bodies. The tumour cells possess enlarged crowded nuclei with some nuclear clearing, grooves and pseudoinclusions. Mitoses are inconspicuous. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen. 
 - Some benign parathyroid gland is incidentally sampled. 
 - Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 1 mitosis per 2 mm2 
 - Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
 - Angionvasion: Not identified 
 - Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
 - Perineural invasion: Not identified 
 - Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
- Surgical margins (for oncocytic adenoma): 
 - Anterior: 0.2 mm (block A3) 
 - Posterior: 1 mm (block A4) 
 - Superior: 20 mm (macroscopic) 
 - Inferior: 0.2 mm (block A2) 
 - Isthmus: Uninvolved 
 - Surgical margins (for papillary carcinoma): 
 - Anterior: 2.2 mm (block A5) 
 - Posterior: 0.4 mm (block A8) 
 - Superior: Uninvolved 
 - Inferior: Uninvolved 
 - Isthmus: Uninvolved 
- Lymph nodes examination: 
 - Two lymph nodes are sampled at the isthmus. One is involved by papillary thyroid carcinoma (2.2mm out of 2.3mm). No extranodal extension is noted. 
 - Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
 - TNM Descriptors: 
 m (multiple primary tumors) 
 - Primary tumor (pT): 
 - pT1a: Tumor < or = 1 cm, limited to the thyroid 
 (B) Section shows lobules of matrue adipocytes travsersed by hypocellular fibrous septa. No atypical stromal cells or lipoblasts are found. Features are consistent with lipoma. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right THYROID, resection 
 - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA (x2) 
 - Pathologic Stage: mpT1a (AJCC 8th edition) 
 - 1 out of 2 lymph nodes involved by papillary carcinoma 
 - ONCOCYTIC ADENOMA (x1) 
 (Please see microscopic description for resection margins) 
 (B) SOFT TISSUE, right neck lipoma, resection 
 - LIPOMA
