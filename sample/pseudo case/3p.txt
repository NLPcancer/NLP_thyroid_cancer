Final Report
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 - Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, infiltrative follicular subtype 
 - Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2 
 - Tumor focality: Multifocal 
 - Tumor size: 8 and 2 mm 
 - Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
 - Angionvasion: Not identified 
 - Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
 - Perineural invasion: Not identified 
 - Extrathyroidal extension: Microscopic invasive of the surrounding fat at the 2 mm tumor nodule. No gross invasion was detected. No involvement of skeletal muscle bundles is detected. 
 - Surgical margins: Uninvolved by carcinoma 
 - Lymph nodes examination: 
   - Number of lymph nodes involved : 1/5. 
   - Extranodal extension (ENE) : Not identified 
   - Size of largest metastatic deposit : 1 mm 
   - Size of largest lymph node involved: 1 mm 
 - Distant metastasis: Not applicable 
 - Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
   - TNM Descriptors: 
      m (multiple primary tumors) 
   - Primary tumor (pT): 
     - pT1a: Tumor < or = 1 cm, limited to the thyroid 
   - Regional lymph nodes (pN): 
     - pN1a: Metastasis to regional nodes 
 - Additional pathologic findings: 
   - Lymphocytic thyroiditis 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Thyroid gland, right hemithyroidectomy: 
    - Papillary thyroid carcinoma (8 mm & 2 mm); 
    - Lymphocytic thyroiditis. 
COMMENTS: 
Report supplemented to add pathological staging and to clarify that the extra-thyroid extension of the tumor is only microscopic and not involving any skeletal muscle. Diagnosis was note changed.
