CLINICAL HISTORY: 
MNG 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Right thyroid, resection, (B) Left thyroid, resection and (C) Right central compartment lymph node, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 
 (A) 'Right thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 15.8 g. The thyroid  measures 5 cm superoinferiorly, 4 cm mediolaterally and up to 2 cm anteroposteriorly. The anterior, posterior and lateral surfaces are inked green, black and blue respectively. 
 A circumscribed nodule with a yellowish cut surface is seen involving the middle pole, lower pole and isthmus, measuring 1.7 cm superoinferiorly, 1.5 cm medioalaterally and 1.5 cm anteroposteriorly. There is another nodule at the middle pole measuring 1.5 cm superoinferiorly, 0.5 cm mediolaterally and 0.6 cm anteroposteriorly. Focally, it is 0.2 cm away from the anterior margin, 0.3 cm away from the laterally margin and 0.3 cm away from the posterior margin. 12 representative blocks. 
 (A1) Isthmus, perpendicularly taken. 
 (A2) Right upper pole. 
 (A3)-(A6) Interface between the two nodules. 
 (A7) Isthmic nodule. 
 (A8)-(A12) Further sampling of the two nodules. 
 (B) 'Left thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 9.3 g and measuring 4.2 cm superoinferiorly, 3 cm mediolaterally and 1.5 cm anteroposteriorly. The anterior,  posterior and lateral margins are inked green, black and blue respectively. Serial sectioning shows an ill-defined nodule measuring 0.1 cm over the upper pole, a 0.4 x 0.3 cm whitish lesion at the middle pole, and an ill-defined 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm whitish nodule located at the lower pole. 6 representative blocks. 
 (B1) Shaved isthmic border. 
 (B2) Upper pole nodule. 
 (B3)&(B4) Middle pole lesion. 
 (B5) Lower pole nodule. 
 (B6) Background thyroid. 
 (C) 'Right central compartment lymph node'. Received is a soft lymph node measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The surface of the specimen is inked green. Bisected and all embedded in 1 block. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
(A) 
- Tumor histology: Sections show a small unencapsulated infiltrative tumor at the isthmus (block A7), adjacent to a large hyperplastic nodule. The tumor consists mostly of neoplastic follicles and focal papillae lined by crowded follicular cells with enlarged irregular nuclei, chromatin clearing, nuclear grooves and occasional intranuclear pseudoinclusions. 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, infiltrative follicular subtype 
- Mitotic count: Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2 
- Tumor size: 3 mm in greatest dimension (block A7) 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angioinvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
- Perineural invasion: Not identified 
- Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
- Surgical margins: Uninvolved by carcinoma 
- Additional findings: Lymphocytic thyroiditis is present in the background. The two large nodules found macroscopically represent hyperplastic nodules with frequent papillary infolding. The largest hyperplastic nodule shows fibrosis and extensive cystic degeneration, featuring granular debris, cholesterol clefts, aggregates of foamy histiocytes and calcifications. 
(B) 
- Tumor histology: Sections show a small unencapsulated infiltrative tumor in the middle pole (blocks B3 & B4). It consists mostly of neoplastic follicles and focal papillae lined by crowded follicular cells with enlarged irregular nuclei, chromatin clearing, nuclear grooves and occasional intranuclear pseudoinclusions. Fibrosis and psammoma bodies are observed. 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, infiltrative follicular subtype 
- Mitotic count: Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2 
- Tumor size: 4 mm in greatest dimension (block B4) 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angioinvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
- Perineural invasion: Not identified 
- Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
- Surgical margins: Carcinoma reaches the anterior surface 
- Additional findings: Lymphocytic thyroiditis is present in the background 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right THYROID, and (B) Left THYROID, resection: 
 - Two foci of PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA, infiltrative follicular subtype 
    - Pathologic stage: mpT1a (AJCC 8th edition) 
    - Largest focus measuring 4 mm 
    - Reaches anterior surface of left lobe 
 - LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS with hyperplastic nodules 
 (C) Right central compartment LYMPH NODE: 
 - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY
