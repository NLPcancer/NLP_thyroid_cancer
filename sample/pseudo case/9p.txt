SPECIMEN(S): 
Final Report 
(A) Right thyroid, resection, (B) Left thyroid, resection and (C) Lymph node, left central compartment LN, resection 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
(A) Designated 'Right thyroid'. Received is a thyroid lobe measuring 40 mm mediolaterally, 49 mm superoinferiorly and 31 mm anteroposteriorly. The pyramidal lobe measures 20 x 13 x 9 mm. It weighs 28.3 g. The anterior margin is inked black and the posterior margin is inked blue. There are three lesions identified. The largest is found at the mid pole, measuring 27 x 22 x 17 mm and has a white cut surface. It measures 1 mm from both the anterior and posterior capsular surface. At the upper pole, the second largest lesion measures 17 x 9 x 9 mm. It measures less than 1 mm from both the anterior and posterior capsular surface. At the lower pole,  there is another circumscribed whitish tumor measures 5 x 5 x 3 mm. It measures 8 mm from the anterior capsular surface and 15 mm from the posterior capsular surface. A piece of peri-thyroidal fatty tissue measures 20 x 10 x 5 mm is found and multiple lymph nodes are within the fatty tissue. Partially embedded in 11 blocks. 
 (A1) Isthmus. 
 (A2) Pyramidal lobe. 
 (A3)&(A4) Mid pole tumor, one complete slab. 
 (A5)&(A6) Mid pole tumor, one complete slab. 
 (A7)&(A8) Upper pole tumor. 
 (A9) Lower pole tumor, all embedded. 
 (A10) Background thyroid. 
 (A11) Peri-thyroidal fatty tissue. 
 (B) Designated 'Left thyroid'. Received is a thyroid lobe measuring 35 mm  mediolaterally, 45 mm superoinferiorly and 15 mm anteroposteriorly. It weighs 11.4 g. The anterior margin is inked in black and the posterior margin is inked in blue. 
On serial sections, a firm whitish tumor is noted at the upper pole, measuring 6 x 4 x 4 mm. It measures less than 1 mm from the posterior capsular surface and 1 mm from the anterior capsular surface. Partially embedded in 3 blocks. 
 (B1) Isthmus. 
 (B2) Upper pole tumor, all embedded. 
 (B3) Background thyroid. 
 (C) 'Left central compartment lymph node'. Received are pieces of fatty tissue  measuring 26 x 12 x 5 mm in aggregates. Multiple lymph nodes are found. All embedded in 2 blocks. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
(A) 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, encapsulated classic subtype 
- Tumor histology: There are two tumors, both are papillary carcinomas. The mid-pole tumor has a thick capsulated with cells arranged in variably-sized follicles with focal papillary structures. Calcifications are present. The tumor cells are cuboidal in shape, showing optically clear nuclei with nuclear overlapping, irregular nuclear contours and nuclear grooves. The tumor is infiltrative and invaded through the fibrous capsule, with tumor cells found in the adjacent thyroid parenchyma. The tumor is situated 2 mm from the posterior capsular surface and 4 mm from the anterior capsular surface. The lower pole tumor shows similar morphology as the mid-pole tumor, and situated 8 mm from the anterior capsular surface. The isthmus is not involved. 
- Mitotic count: <3 mitoses per 2mm2 
- Tumor focality: Multifocal 
- Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
- Angionvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
- Perineural invasion: Not identified 
- Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
- Additional findings:  The upper pole tumor is well-circumscribed adenomatoud nodule, composed of variably-sized colloid-containing follicles. The follicular cells show uniform bland-looking nuclei without nuclear feature papillary thyroid carcinoma. Other parts of the gland shows chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. 
- Regional lymph nodes examination: 
- Number of lymph nodes involved: 4 out of 7 
- Extranodal extension (ENE) : Not identified 
- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
- TNM Descriptors: m (multiple primary tumors) 
- Primary tumor: pT2. Tumor > 2 cm, but < or = 4 cm, limited to thyroid 
(B) 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype. 
- Tumor histology: The left gland tumor is infiltrative and composed of variably-sized follicles and papillary structures, surrounded by dense sclerotic stroma. Calcifications are noted. The tumor cells show optically clear nuclei with irregular nuclear contours, nuclear overlapping and nuclear grooves. No lymphovascular invasion or extrathyroidal extension is observed. The tumor measures 0.3 mm from the posterior capsular surface and 1 mm from the anterior capsular surface. The isthmus is not involved. The background parenchyma shows chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. 
(C) Sections show 8 lymph nodes. 4 out of the 8 lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma. No extranodal extension is observed. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
(A) Right THYROID, resection: 
   - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA 
   - Stage pT2(m) (AJCC TNM 8th Edition) 
   - Resection margins clear 
   - chronic LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS 
   - 4 out of 7 lymph nodes involved by metastatic carcinoma 
(B) Left THYROID, resection: 
   - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA 
   - Chronic LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS 
(C) LYMPH NODE, left central compartment, resection: 
   - METASTATIC CARCINOMA (4/8)
