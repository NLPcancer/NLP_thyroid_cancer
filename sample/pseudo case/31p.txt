CLINICAL HISTORY:
Left thyroid nodule

SPECIMEN(S):
Central compartment lymph node, resection

GROSS EXAMINATION:
Specimen consists of a lymph node measuring 0.5 cm across. Bisected and all embedded

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Section shows adipose tissue and reactive lymph node. Hemorrhage into the adipose tissue is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
Central compartment LYMPH NODE, resection - NO MALIGNANCY.

Final Report
Date Requested: 09/06/2018 Date Arrived: 09/06/2018 

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Left thyroid nodule

SPECIMEN(S):
(A) Left thyroid, excision and (B) right thyroid, excision

GROSS EXAMINATION:
(A) A multinodular piece of thyroid tissue weighing 15 g. It measures 5 x 3 x 2 cm. Sectioning shows infiltration by tumor 4.5 x 3 x 2cm. 6 representative blocks with the tumour all embedded.
(B) A piece of thyroid tissue weighing 5 g and measuring 4 x 2 x 2 cm. Serial sectioning shows a white coloured tumour measuring 1 cm in size. 2 representative blocks with the tumour all embedded.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
(A) Sections of the left thyroid tumour show papillary thyroid carcinoma arranged in follicular pattern with an infiltrative border. It has invaded beyond the capsule into the surrounding striated muscle. The anterior and posterior inked surfaces are focally involved. The tumor cells bear optically clear nuclei, nuclear grooves and pseudonuclear inclusions among a sclerotic stroma. Lymphovascular permeation is present. One lymph node is sampled within the specimen and showed metastatic carcinoma. The metastatic focus measures 4mm. No extranodal extension is seen.
(B) The right thyroid nodule is surrounded by a thin and complete fibrous capsule. There is irregular fibrosis of the capsule with dystrophic calcification, and likely secondary to repeated fine needle aspiration. The follicles within and outside the nodule appear similar and without frank cytologic features of papillary carcinoma. A piece of benign parathyroid tissue is also included.

DIAGNOSIS:
(A)	Left THYROID, excision
-	Papillary thyroid carcinoma, infiltrative follicular subtype. 
-	Anterior and posterior margins focally involved.
-	One lymph node with metastatic carcinoma.
(B)	RIGHT THYROID, excision â€“ follicular adenoma.
