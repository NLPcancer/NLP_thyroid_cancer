F/51Y 
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 Right thyroid nodule 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 Right thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
  'Right thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 9.9 g. It measures 4 cm superoinferiorly, 3 cm mediolaterally and 1.5 cm anteroposteriorly. The anterior, posterior and lateral surfaces are inked green, black and blue, respectively. 
 Sectioning shows a whitish firm solid tumor measuring 1.8 cm superoinferiorly, 1.6 cm mediolaterally and 1.1 cm anteroposteriorly spanning across upper-mid pole. 
 Focally it extends to the anterior and posterior margins. Partially embedded in 7 representative blocks. 
 (1) Isthmus. 
 (2)-(6) Tumour, all embedded. 
 (7) Random block, lower pole. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 Sections of the thyroid show an infiltrative carcinoma arranged in papillary fronds. 
 The tumor cells bear optically clear nuclei, nuclear grooves and occasional pseudonuclear inclusions. Squamoid metaplasia is focally seen. The mitotic count is less than 3 per 2mm2; no necrosis is identified. Extrathyroidal extension is present, as evidenced by microscopic invasion of tumor into skeletal muscle. All resection margins are clear, in which the minimal microscopic clearance is seen at the posterior and anterior margins, measuring 0.3 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. 
 Lymphovascular permeation is observed. Seven lymph nodes are sampled, 4 of which show metastatic carcinoma. Extranodal extension is absent. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right thyroid, resection: 
 - Papillary thyroid carcinoma, classic type.
