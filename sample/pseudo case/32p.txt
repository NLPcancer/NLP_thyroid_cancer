Final Report

CLINICAL HISTORY:
CA thyroid

SPECIMEN(S):
Thyroid gland, excision: (A) Right thyroid: (B) Left thyroid and (C) Left central compartment LN

GROSS EXAMINATION:
(Specimens received in formalin)
(A) The right lobe of thyroid weighs 5 g and measures 4.9 cm superoinferiorly, up to 2.8 cm transversely and 1.2 cm anteroposteriorly. Cut sections show no distinct nodule or suspicious lesion. The isthmic margin is inked blue, the anterior surface is inked yellow and the posterior surface is inked green. Multiple pieces partially embedded in 2 blocks.

(B) The left lobe of thyroid including the isthmus weighs 30 g and measures 6 cm superoinferiorly, up to 6.5 cm transversely and 3.5 cm anteroposteriorly. Cut sections confirm that the left lobe is extensively occupied by a large, multinodular, pink to tan and solid tumour with focal coarse calcifications. It measures up to 6 m superoinferiorly, 3.2 cm transversely and 2.5 cm anteroposteriorly. Multiple small rounded or elongated nodules are found immediately adjacent to the tumour in the posterior and lateral aspects. The isthmic margin is inked blue, the anterior surface is inked yellow and the posterior surface is inked green. Partially embedded in 12 blocks.

(B1) Soft tissue above isthmic region.
(B2) Bisected isthmic region.
(B3) Inferior pole taken radially.
(B4) Superior pole taken radially.
(B5)(B6), (B7)&(B8), (B9)&(B10), (B11)&(B12) Transverse slabs of tumour.

(C) Two pieces of fatty tissue measuring 1 to 2 cm across. All embedded in 1 block.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
(A) Sections of the right thyroid show no significant pathology or evidence of malignancy.

(B)
- Histologic type: Follicular carcinoma, widely invasive
- Angionvasion: Extensive (= or > 4 vessels)
- Tumour histology: Crowded small and some medium-sized follicles: scanty eosinophilic cytoplasm, uniformly round nuclei with granular chromatin. Focal capsular invasion and extension into normal parenchyma. Frequent tumour emboli in adjacent veins.
- Extrathyroidal extension: Focally into adjacent fibroadipose tissue (block B3)
- Surgical margins:
- Inferior (block B3): Involved
- Lateral (block B11): Involved

- Superior (block B4): Involved
- Posterior (block B7): Involved
- Anterior: clear

(C) The section shows two pieces of fibroadipose tissue. In one of them, an oval-shaped nodule, containing several clusters of tumour cells resembling those seen in (B) is present. No surrounding rim of lymph node tissue is evident. Immunostaining for CD31 does not highlight any surrounding endothelial cells. The other piece contains three small benign lymph nodes and some parathyroid tissue.


DIAGNOSIS:
(A) Right thyroid, total thyroidectomy
- No malignancy.

(B) Left THYROID, total thyroidectomy
- FOLLICULAR CARCINOMA.
- Extensive vascular invasion
- Margins involved

(C) Left central compartment lymph nodes, excision
- Nodule of follicular carcinoma in adipose tissue (please see microscopic description).
- No malignancy in the 3 lymph nodes included:
- Parathyroid tissue present.
