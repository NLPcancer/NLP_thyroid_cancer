F/57Y 
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 Left CA thyroid 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 Left thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 'Left thyroid'. Received is a left thyroid weighing 9.2 g and measuring 4.5 cm superoinferiorly, 3 cm mediolaterally and 1 cm anteroposteriorly. The isthmus is included, which measures 1.5 cm superoinferiorly, 2.3 cm mediolaterally and 0.3 cm anteroposteriorly. Serial sectioning shows tan-coloured tumour in the middle pole, which measures 0.5 cm anteroposteriorly, 0.4 cm superoinferiorly and 0.4 cm mediolaterally. It is located 1 cm from the superior margin and 2 cm from the inferior margin and well clear of the isthmic margin. Adjacent to this tumour is a colloid nodule measuring up to 0.8 cm in size. The anterior surface is inked yellow and posterior surface is inked green. All embedded in 8 blocks. 
 (1)-(2) Tumour in middle pole, entirely submitted. 
 (3) Isthmus. 
 (4)-(8) Background thyroid. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 - Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma 
 - Tumor focality: Multifocal 
 - Tumor size: 5 mm (middle pole; block 1), 2.5 mm (isthmus; block 3) 
 - Tumor histology: 
 - Sections show 2 foci of papillary thyroid carcinoma situated in the middle pole and isthmus respectively. The former tumour features papillary proliferation of carcinoma cells in a fibrotic stroma with scattered psammoma bodies; while the latter is composed of tumour cells arranged in follicular architecture. The carcinoma cells exhibit enlarged, crowded and hyperchromatic nuclei with grooves and occasional pseudoinclusions. Mitotic figures are inconspicuous. Features are consistent with papillary carcinoma. No definite microscopic extrathyroidal extension is seen. The background thyroid shows a colloid nodule and reactive lymphoid aggregates with Hurthle cell change, consistent with lymphocytic thyroiditis. 
 - Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2 
 - Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
 - Angionvasion: Not identified 
 - Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
 - Perineural invasion: Not identified 
 - Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
 - Surgical margins for intrathyroidal tumours: 
 - Anterior: 1 mm (block 1) 
 - Posterior: 2 mm (block 3) 
 - Isthmic: 4 mm (block 3) 
 [Please see below for the surgical margin of the involved lymph node.] 
 - Lymph nodes examination: 
 - 5 lymph nodes identified at the isthmus, 1 of which is involved by papillary thyroid carcinoma. This metastatic deposit measures up to 2.5 mm in size and is situated less than 0.1 mm from the posterior margin (block 3). 
 - No extranodal extension is seen. 
 - Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
 - TNM Descriptors: 
 m (multiple primary tumors) 
 - Primary tumor (pT): 
 - pT1a: Tumor < or = 1 cm, limited to the thyroid 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left THYROID, resection 
 - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA (x2) 
 - Pathologic Stage mpT1a 
 - 1 out of 5 lymph nodes involved 
 - Close to resection margins 
 - LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS
