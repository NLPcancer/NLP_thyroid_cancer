F/61Y 

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 Right thyroid nodule 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 Right thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
  'Right thyroid'. Received is a lobe of thyroid weighing 6.2 g. It measures 4.3 cm superoinferiorly, 2.6 cm mediolaterally and 1.3 cm anteroposteriorly. The anterior, posterior and lateral margins are inked green, black and blue respectively. Serial sectioning shows a whitish solid nodule measuring 1.2 cm superoinferiorly, 0.6 cm anteroposteriorly and 0.5 cm mediolaterally. It focally extends to the anterior margin. Another smaller nodule measuring about 0.2 cm across is seen 1 cm superior to the larger nodule. Partially embedded in 7 blocks. 
 (1) Isthmus (shaved margin). 
 (2) Random block, upper pole. 
 (3) Smaller nodule, all embedded. 
 (4)-(6) 1.2-cm nodule, all embedded. 
 (7) Lower pole. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 Sections from the two nodules show carcinoma arranged in follicular pattern with an infiltrative border. The tumor cells bear optically clear nuclei, nuclear grooves and occasional pseudonuclear inclusions among a sclerotic stroma. The mitotic count is less than 3 per 2mm2. The smaller nodule (1.5 mm in dimension microscopically) represents extrathyroidal extension into peri-thyroidal adipose tissue. 
 Angioinvasion or lymphatic invasion is not identified. One benign lymph node is present. All resection margins are microscopically clear, with a minimal clearance of 0.1 mm from the anterior margin. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right thyroid, resection: 
 - Papillary carcinoma, infiltrative follicular subtype.
