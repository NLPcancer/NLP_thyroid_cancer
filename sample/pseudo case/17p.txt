CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 
CA thyroid 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Right level III lymph node, resection and (B) Right thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 'Right level III lymph node'. The specimen consists of two pieces of pale yellowish tissue. The larger piece measures 1.4 x 1 x 0.5 cm and is bisected. All embedded in 1 block. 
 (B) 'Right thyroid'. The specimen consists of the right thyroid gland weighing 16.3 g. It measures 4 cm from superior to inferior, 3.4 cm from side to side and 2 cm anteroposteriorly. Soft tissue 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm is attached to the inferior pole. The upper pole is partially bisected revealing whitish lesion and serial sections show a whitish lesion 11 mm diameter. The posterior is painted black and the anterior is painted blue. The inferior is inked red. 
 (B1) Isthmic margin, shaved. 
 (B2)-(B7) Medial longitudinal slab including the bigger nodule. 
 (B8)&(B10) Additional adjacent slab including bigger nodule. 
 (B11) Lower pole. 
 (B12)-(B15) Transverse sections of lateral aspect including lateral border of whitish lesion, All embedded. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 
 - Lymph nodes examination: 
  - Number of lymph nodes sampled: 2 
  - Number of lymph nodes involved: 1 (the larger piece) 
  - Extranodal extension (ENE) : Not identified 
  - Size of largest metastatic deposit (mm): 1 
  - Size of largest lymph node involved (mm): 10 
(B) 
- Tumor histology and immunohistochemical studies: 
  - Sections of the nodule show irregular aggregate of papillary carcinoma in form of papillae and glandular structures lined by columnar cells with clear nuclei and nuclear grooving. Focally, patchy fibrosis is noted around the carcinoma, compatible with reaction to aspiration.  
The carcinoma reaches the anterior and anterolateral capsule without breaching the capsule. It extends to 1 mm from posterior margin. The isthmic margin is clear. 
- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): 
  - Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2, specify: 
- Tumor focality: 
  - Multifocal 
- Tumor size: 
  - Greatest dimension (mm): 11mm 
- Tumor necrosis: 
  - Not identified 
- Angionvasion: Not identified 
- Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
- Perineural invasion: Not identified 
- Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
- Lymph nodes examination: 
  - Number of lymph nodes sampled around the thyroid gland: 21 
  - Number of lymph nodes involved: 5 
  - Extranodal extension (ENE) : Not identified 
  - Size of largest metastatic deposit (mm): 5 
  - Size of largest lymph node involved (mm): 8 
- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
  - Primary tumor (pT): 
    - pT1b: Tumor > 1 cm but < or = 2 cm, limited to the thyroid 
  - Regional lymph nodes (pN): 
    - pN1b: Metastasis to unilateral, bilateral, or contralateral lateral neck lymph nodes (levels I, II, III, IV, or V) or retropharyngeal lymph nodes 
- Additional pathologic findings: 
  - Thyroiditis: The thyroid tissue show diffuse dense lymphocytic infiltration throughout the gland, frequent lymphoid follicles with germinal centre formation. 
Most of the thyroid follicles are filled with colloid and some follicles appear atrophic. 
   - A parathyroid tissue is also present. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right level III LYMPH NODE, resection 
 - METASTATIC PAPILLARY CARCINOMA (1/2) 
 (B) Right THYROID, resection 
 - PAPILLARY CARCINOMA, THYROID gland 
 - METASTATIC PAPILLARY CARCINOMA, LYMPH NODES (5/21) 
 - THYROIDITIS
