CLINICAL HISTORY: 
CA thyroid 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
  (A) Right thyroid, resection, (B) Left thyroid, resection and (C) Right central 
 compartment LN, resection. 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (A) Designated 'Right thyroid'. Received is a thyroid lobe measuring 55 mm superoinferiorly, 37 mm mediolaterally and 28 mm anteroposteriorly. It weighs 25 g. 
 The pyramidal lobe measures 20 x 6 x 3 mm. Some skeletal muscle tissue is noted anteriorly, measuring 34 x 23 mm in surface area. The anterior surface is inked black and the posterior surface is inked blue. On serial section, a firm whitish tumor with irregular borders is found spanning from mid to lower pole, measuring 36 x 32 x 26 mm. It shows whitish cut surfaces, and measures less than 1 mm from both the anterior and posterior surfaces. Another firm whitish tumor with irregular borders is found at the upper pole, measuring 14 x 8 x 9 mm. It shows whitish cut surfaces, and measures less than 1 mm from both the anterior and posterior surface. 
 Partially embedded in 11 blocks. 
 (A1) Isthmus. 
 (A2) Pyramidal lobe. 
 (A3)&(A4) Mid to lower pole tumor, one complete slab. 
 (A5)&(A6) Mid to lower pole tumor, one complete slab. 
 (A7)&(A8) Upper pole tumor, all embedded. 
 (A9) Background thyroid. 
 (A10)&(A11) Mid to lower pole tumor, one complete slab. 
 
 (B) Designated 'Left thyroid'. Received is a thyroid lobe measuring 28 mm mediolaterally, 45 mm superoinferiorly and 17 mm anteroposteriorly. It weighs 10 g. 
 The anterior surface is inked in black and the posterior surface is inked in blue. 
 On serial sections, no mass lesion is identified. Partially embedded in 4 blocks. 
 (B1) Isthmus. 
 (B2)-(B4) Thyroid. 
 (C) Designated 'Right central compartment LN'. Received are two pieces of fatty tissue measuring 15 x 6 x 5 mm and 6 x 7 x 4 mm respectively. All embedded in 1 block. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 
 - Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
 - Tumor histology:  The mid to lower pole tumor shows a partially encapsulated, infiltrative tumor mainly arranged in papillary structures and variably-sized follicles, admixed with patchy chronic inflammatory infiltrates and surrounded by sclerotic stroma. The capsule is infiltrated by the tumor cells. The tumor cells are cuboidal to columnar-shaped, showing optically clear nuclei with nuclear overlapping, irregular nuclear contours and nuclear grooves. The tumor closely abuts the anterior strap muscles, but no unequivocal invasion is present. A single small nest of tumor cells is found in the surrounding parenchyma, separate from the main tumor mass. This mid to lower pole tumor measures 0.3 mm from both the anterior and posterior margins. The upper pole tumor shows similar cytoarchitectural features, measuring 0.2 mm from both the anterior and posterior surfaces. The isthmus margin is clear. 
 - Mitotic count: <3 mitoses per 2mm2 
 - Tumor focality: Multifocal 
 - Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
 - Angionvasion: Suspicious foci 
 - Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
 - Perineural invasion: Not identified 
 - Extrathyroidal extension: Not identified 
 - Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition): 
   - Primary tumor: pT2. Tumor > 2 cm, but < or = 4 cm, limited to thyroid 
 - Additional pathologic findings: Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. One parathyroid gland included. Two reactive lymph nodes found in the peri-thyroidal soft tissue. 
 (B) Sections of the thyroid show colloid-containing follicles and frequent lymphoid follicles with germinal centers formation. No nuclear feature diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma is present. Two reactive lymph nodes are found at the isthmus. There is no malignancy. 
  
(C) Section shows four reactive lymph nodes. There is no malignancy. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right THYROID, resection: 
    - PAPILLARY CARCINOMA, classic subtype 
    - pT2 (AJCC 8th Edition) 
    - Chronic LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS 
    - Two reactive lymph nodes present (0/2) 
 (B) Left THYROID, resection: 
    - Chronic LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS 
    - Two reactive lymph nodes present (0/2) 
 (C) LYMPH NODE, right central compartment, resection: 
    - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/4)
