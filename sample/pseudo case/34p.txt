Final Report

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Right papillary thyroid carcinoma


SPECIMEN(S):
Thyroid gland, resection: (A) Right and (B) Left

GROSS EXAMINATION:
(Specimen received in formalin)

(A) 'Right thyroid gland'. It weighs 25.8 g. It consists of the right thyroid gland including the pyramidal lobe at the isthmus. The specimen measures 5 cm mediolaterally 5.5cm from superior to inferior and 2 cm from anterior to posterior.sectioining of the thyroid tissue reveals multiple solid whitish, irregularly shaped nodules located within the upper pole as well as the mid-pole. Areas of calcification are seen.The upper pole nodule measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm while mid-pole nodule measures 1.9 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm,   These nodules reach the thyroid capsular surface in areas. coming to to within 1cm of the isthmus, A firm nodule is found within the isthmus, measuring 0.5 cm across.

The anterior surface is inked green, the posterior surface is inked blue. Partially embedded in 10 blocks.

(A1)-(A4) Mid pole nodule, entirely submitted.
(A5)-(A8) Superior pole, perpendicularly taken.
(A7)-(A8) Superior pole nodule, entirely submitted.
(A9)-(A10) Isthmic and pyramidal lobe with a firm solid noted in block (A9).
partially embedded.

(B) An enlarged green thyroid gland measures 5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The anterior surface is inked nodular, the posterior surface is inked blue. Sectioning of the thyroid tissue shows a reddish fleshy appearance. A necrotic cystic nodule is located at the inferior pole, filled with yellowish material. The nodule measures 1.2 cm across. Partially embedded in 5 blocks.

(B1) Superior pole, perpendicularly sections.
(B2)-(B3) Mid pole, representative sections.
(B4)-(B5) Necrotic nodule with block (B4) representing the perpendicular margin.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
(A)
- Tumor histology:
- Multifocal papillary carcinoma are seen at the superior pole as well as the mid-pole, measuring 24.5 mm (block A8), 19.3 mm (block A1) and 3.8 mm across respectively. The first two show similar features, exhibiting an intricate pattern of elongated papillae lined by tall columnar cells between well defined cytoplasmic borders and granular cytoplasm. Colloid is seen between the papillae. Areas of tram- track pattern are readily identified seen.the cells display characteristic cytological features of papillary thyroid carcinom, such as overlapping enlarged nuclei, nuclear grooving and pseudoinclusions, There are areas of dense fibrosis and dysplastic calcification. Extrathyroidal extension readily seen, with tumours invading skeletal muscle at the superior pole of the thyroid (A1) as well as the deep surface (block A8). The inked deep surgical margins are involved (block A1, A7, A8). The thrid focus of papillary carcinoma is an encapsulated papillary thyroid carcinoma located at the isthmus.

- Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, tall cell variant
- Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): 7
- Tumor focality:
- Multifocal
- Tumor size:
- Greatest dimension (mm): 24.5 mm 
- Angioinvasion: Extensive (= or >4 vessels) (A2)
- Lymphatic invasion: Not identified
- Perineural invasion: Not identified
- Extrathyroid extension: Invading subcutaneous soft tissues, larynx, trachea, esophagus or recurrent laryngeal nerve (please correlate with surgical and radiological findings)

- Surgical margins: Involved by carcinoma, specify:
- Deep margin: Involved (block A1, A7, A8)
- Superior pole margin: Involved (A1)
- Anterior margin: Clear, 0.2 mm (A8)

- Pathologic stage classification (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition):
- TNM Descriptors:
m: Multiple primary tumors
- Primary tumor (pT):
- pT4a: Gross extrathyroidal extension invading subcutaneous soft tissues,larynx, trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve from a tumor of any size


- Additional findings:
- A reactive lymph node is seen at the isthmus (A10) 
- Intrathyroidal parathyroid tissue is seen (block A2)

(B) Sections show thyroid tissue composed of multiple variably sized nodules with dilated colloid rich follicles. Focal areas of fibrosis, cystic change,  cholesterol clefts,and haemorrhage are seen.  The follicular epithelium shows no atypia.nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma are not seen. These findings are those of nodular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:
(A) THYROID GLAND, right, resection:
- Multifocal PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA, 24.5 mm, 19.3 mm, 3.8 mm
- With extrathyroidal extension and extensive angioinvasion.
- Stage pT4aN0 (pTNM, AJCC 8th edition) (please correlate with clinical findings).
- 1 reactive lymph node present.
- Margins involved.

(B) THYROID GLAND, left, resection:
- NODULAR HYPERPLASIA.
