CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 CA thyroid 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 (A) Right central compartment lymph node, resection, (B) Right thyroid, resection and (C) Left thyroid, resection 
 
GROSS EXAMINATION: 
 (A) 'Right central compartment lymph node'. Received is a piece of tan-coloured tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm. All embedded in 1 block. 
 (B) 'Right thyroid'. Received is a right thyroid weighing 3.3 g and measuring 3.5 cm superoinferiorly, 1.6 cm mediolaterally and 1 cm anteroposteriorly. Serial sectioning shows a tan-coloured tumour measuring up to 1.1 cm superoinferiorly, 1 cm mediolaterally and 0.8 cm anteroposteriorly. It is situated 1.2 cm from the superior margin and 1 cm from the inferior margin. It closely abuts the anterior and posterior margins. The anterior surface is inked yellow, posterior surface is inked green and isthmic margin is inked black. 4 representative blocks are taken. 
 (B1) Isthmic margin. 
 (B2)-(B3) Tumour, entirely submitted. 
 (B4) Background thyroid. 
(C) 'Left thyroid'. Received is a left thyroid weighing 9.1 g and measuring 3.5 cm superoinferiorly, 2.5 cm mediolaterally and 2 cm anteroposteriorly. Serial sectioning shows a colloid nodule measuring 2 cm superoinferiorly, 2.1 cm mediolaterally and 1.5 cm anteroposteriorly. No other focal lesion is seen. The anterior surface is inked yellow, posterior surface is inked green and isthmic margin is inked black. 4 representative blocks are taken. 
 (C1)-(C3) Colloid nodule. 
 (C4) Background thyroid adjacent to colloid nodule. 
 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: 
 (A) Section shows fibroadipose tissue with a focus of benign thyroid parenchyma. No lymph node tissue is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
 (B) 
 - Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, classic subtype 
 - Tumor focality: Unifocal 
 - Tumor size: Greatest dimension: 11 mm (macroscopic) 
 - Tumor histology: 
 - The tumour is composed of carcinoma cells arranged in papillary and follicular architecture in a fibrotic stroma with foci of calcification. There is microscopic extrathyroidal extension of tumour cells into adjacent skeletal muscle bundles. The tumour cells possess enlarged crowded nuclei with nuclear clearing, occasional grooves and pseudoinclusions. Mitotic figures are inconspicuous. Features are consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. The background thyroid shows a colloid nodule. 
 - Mitotic count (per 2 mm2): Less than 3 mitoses per 2mm2 
 - Tumor necrosis: Not identified 
 - Angionvasion: Not identified 
 - Lymphatic invasion: Not identified 
 - Perineural invasion: Not identified 
 - Extrathyroidal extension: Microscopic extrathyroidal extension to skeletal muscle anterior to the thyroid gland is present (Block B2). Please correlate with operative findings to delineate the extent of gross extrathyroidal extension. 
 - Surgical margins: 
 - Anterior: 0.2 mm (block B2) 
 - Posterior: 1.5 mm (block B2) 
(C) Section shows a hyperplastic nodule composed of follicles of various sizes and colloid content. It shows extensive areas of fibrosis with infiltration of foamy macrophages, cholesterol clefts and haemosiderin deposition. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
 
DIAGNOSIS: 
 (A) Right central compartment LYMPH NODE, resection 
 - No lymph node tissue found; NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY 
 (B) Right THYROID, resection 
 - PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA with microscopic extrathyroidal extension; close to resection margins 
 (please see microscopic description) 
 (C) Left THYROID, resection 
 - HYPERPLASTIC NODULE
